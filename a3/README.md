## Introduction: ##
This project will introduce you to the idea of first building an occupancy grid then using that grid to estimate a robot's motion using a particle filter.

There are two objectives to complete:
  - Objective 1: Implement occupancy mapping algorithm
  - Objective 2: Implement particle filter to localize from known map



## Objective 1: ##
